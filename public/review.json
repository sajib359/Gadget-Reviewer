It's pairing well with my Fiio m3pro. Iam using the trn T2 upgrade cable cause the stock cable causes a lot of noise.",

But the fitting is good and vocals are amazing to hear. If you are a balaced sound lover then you can buy it. The bass quantity is good but quality is bad. Mid bass will impress you but there are much lackings of sub bass.",
